            <p>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;One of the best inter colleges Technical  event is  INTER IIT TECH MEET in which all the IITs come to play with an aim to provide the best minds of the country a pedestal to take part, showcase their technical skills and act as a medium for exchange of ideas.Further, this will also help in fostering relations while bridging the gaps among the Indian Institutes of Technology. It is organised in one of the IIT every year and is organised with all its best facilities and measures. Last time, it was organised in IIT Kanpur in December 2012. This is the best oppurtunity for every IIT-ian to prove (him/her) self.</p>
            <p> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;This time IIT Bombay is hosting the Inter IIT TECH MEET in Januray 2014. </p>

                        </div>
                        <p>Following are some of the ideas as suggestions to help you guide towards the goal we are aiming. These are just the suggestions and not the problem statement.</p>
                        <ol>
                          <li><b>Helping the blind:</b> People with complete blindness or low vision often have a difficult time self-navigating outside well-known environments. In fact, physical movement is one of the biggest challenges for blind people. Traveling or simply walking down a crowded street may pose great difficulty. Because of this, many people with low vision will bring a sighted friend or family member to help navigate unknown environments. Find a possible solution to make them more independent.
                          Another problem faced by blind people is to read, as not all books are available in braille. Device a mechanism that could overcome this. </li>

                          <li><b>Separating plastic from garbage:</b> "Total plastic waste which is collected and recycled in the country is estimated to be 9,205 tonnes per day (approximately 60% of total plastic waste) and 6,137 tonnes remain uncollected and littered," the CPCB said. The unrecycled waste either enters our landfills or our marine ecosystem creating an ecological imbalance. </br> 
                          Presently a lot of manpower goes into separating plastic from the garbage at the end. Using available technology, we can make this process autonomous. For e.g. the different properties of plastic can be used to separate it from different wastes. Device a mechanism that could separate plastic from the other organic and inorganic waste.</li> 

                          <li><b>A Blood bank network:</b> One of the basic problem faced by the world today is the communication gap between the blood donor, blood seeker and the blood bank. Ideas are invited to connect the bloodseeker, the donor and the blood bank in a way that is accessible to everyone and everywhere. The software should provide the data of the donor in the nearest locality with his full information and the easiest way to contact them at the earliest. </li>

                          <li><b>Making the transport in hilly areas easy:</b> Consider school going kids in hilly areas, the only means of transport for them is by foot or cycle as the buses are not that frequent. But its very difficult to cycle uphill. Provide a cheap solution to reduce the power needed to cycle uphill.</li>

                          <li><b>Effective utilization of wind energy:</b> Although wind energy is one of the prominent and easily utilizable source of natural energy, the main hurdle is the cost of installation and maintenance. Initial cost for wind turbines is greater than that of conventional fossil fuel generators per MW installed. Further, noise is produced by the rotor blades. It may also cause harads to local bird species.To devise a SMALL, efficient, low cost and easily maintainable model for wind mill for lifting water using natural parts (like bamboo sticks etc) which can easily be repaired on site by the villagers.</li>

                          <li><b>Safety of Elders:</b> Falling is a serious issue among the elderly population resulting several times in critical injuries. With elderly who live alone, not being found for hours after a fall is quite common and can have drastic consequences. Give a feasible and inexpensive solution in the form of an electronics gadget that could detect their fall automatically and inform the person’s family members.

          <h3>Messiar Marathon</h3>
          <p>The competition draws its roots from the French Astronomer, Charles Messier of the 18th Century.He was an avid comet hunter, who was frustrated by objects which resembled but were not comets.So, he along with his assistant Pierre Mechain compiled a list of such objects, popularly known asMessier Catalogue. A Messier Marathon is an attempt, usually organized by amateur astronomers,to find as many Messier Objects as possible during one night. The Messier Catalogue consists of 110relatively bright deep sky objects (galaxies, nebulae and star clusters).</p>

                              <br />There is a collection of 110 deep-space objects like nebulae, clusters, galaxies etc. that was compiled by the astronomer Charles Messier. A Messier Marathon is a popular competition for amateur astronomers in which participants point out as many Messier objects as they can with a telescope through the course of the night.
